description: Single source of truth for all agent collaboration contracts -- what each role depends on, produces, and gatekeeps across all delivery phases. Update this file when any artifact flow, dependency, or approval gate changes. All agents load this at runtime.

# Collaboration Contracts

This is the single source of truth for artifact flows across the team. When a collaboration model changes, update this file only -- do not update individual agent files.

## How to use this skill

When this skill is loaded, treat every contract in this file as a hard constraint. Before any handoff, approval, or phase transition, re-read the relevant section and verify your action is permitted. Do not rely on memory of a prior read.

At every 👤 human gate, follow `artifact-review-rule.md`: output the full artifact MD in the response, then use `AskUserQuestion` with **Approve** and **Request changes**.

## PM <> User

**PM depends on:**
- Reqs -- gathered from User before authoring PRD

**PM produces:**
- `prd.md` -- single document covering PRD, app flows, ACs, and risks; PM is gatekeeper

---

## PM <> Designer

**PM provides to Designer:**
- PRD, ACs -- approved by PM; triggers Mock creation

**Designer provides to PM:**
- Mocks (draft) -- iterated until PM approves

**PM produces (joint with Designer):**
- Mocks -- PM is gatekeeper; not final until PM sets `Status: Approved`

---

**EM depends on:**
- PRD, ACs -- approved by PM before authoring Eng Plans (HLD)

---

## PM <> QA

---

## PM <> BE / FE

BE and FE do not receive formal artifact handoffs from PM. EM is the kickoff point and explicitly forwards relevant artifacts. BE and FE may ask PM targeted questions about existing PRD/Reqs/ACs content -- read-only clarification only (see Clarification access).

---

## EM <> Arch

**EM provides to Arch:**

---

## QA <> DevOps (smoke testing)

Applies to non-local deployments only. After infrastructure is provisioned, DevOps and QA run a smoke test loop before the infra-verification human gate.

**DevOps provides to QA:**
- Live server URL -- handed off after deployment; triggers QA smoke run

**QA provides to DevOps:**
- Failing test case name + full error details -- reported directly when any smoke check fails; DevOps remediates before QA re-runs

**QA owns:**
- API-level smoke check -- scripted HTTP calls against the live server covering key flows (e.g. auth, health)
- E2E smoke spec -- headless browser run covering critical UI paths

**Loop exit condition:**
- All smoke checks pass (exit 0) -- QA confirms to DevOps and EM; infra-verification gate opens

**DevOps depends on:**
- QA smoke pass confirmation -- required before Infrastructure Verification artifact is produced and the human gate is opened

**QA depends on:**
- Live server URL from DevOps -- required before smoke run begins

---

## Arch gatekeeping

Arch must approve before any role proceeds with a new tech stack or AWS component.

**Gatekeeps (must approve before downstream proceeds):**
- Tech stack adoption -- any new language, framework, or major library proposed by EM, BE, FE, or Swift Engineer requires Arch approval before use
- AWS component adoption -- any new AWS service or infrastructure component proposed by EM, BE, FE, or DevOps requires Arch approval before provisioning

---

## Clarification access

During planning and implementation, BE, FE, Swift Engineer, QA, and DevOps may ask PM targeted questions about existing PRD/Reqs/ACs content, and ask Designer or macOS Designer targeted questions about existing Mocks content. These are read-only clarifications on artifacts already in scope -- not requirement gathering, not scope discussions, not design revision requests.

If a clarification conversation reveals a gap, missing requirement, or needed design revision, the agent must stop, file it to `BACKLOG.md` per the backlog-reporting-rule (use `type: gap` with the appropriate area: `Spec`, `Mocks`, or `Contract`), and surface it to EM. Agents must not self-resolve or ask PM/Designer to revise artifacts in the moment -- any change to scope or design goes back through EM.

---

## PM <> macOS Designer

**PM provides to macOS Designer:**
- PRD, ACs -- approved by PM; triggers Mock creation

**macOS Designer provides to PM:**
- Mocks (draft) -- iterated until PM approves

## macOS Designer <> Swift Engineer

Swift Engineer does not receive a formal Mocks handoff from macOS Designer. EM forwards approved Mocks and component spec to Swift Engineer at kickoff. Swift Engineer may ask macOS Designer targeted questions about existing Mocks -- read-only clarification only (see Clarification access).

When Swift Engineer identifies a control or behavior that cannot be implemented as specified (SwiftUI limitation, AppKit interop required), they raise a feasibility issue to macOS Designer before implementing a workaround. Any design revision goes back through EM.

---

## Swift Engineer <> QA

**Swift Engineer provides to QA:**
- Swift Engineer Artifacts + Swift Test Docs -- required before QA can author Swift automation
- `accessibilityIdentifier` map -- documents identifiers used in the view layer so QA can write reliable XCUITest selectors

**QA depends on from Swift Engineer:**
- Swift Engineer Artifacts + Swift Test Docs -- received from Swift Engineer before authoring automation
- `accessibilityIdentifier` map -- required before writing XCUITest selectors

---

## EM produces (standalone)

- `## Progress` in `workflow/workflow.md` -- progressively filled by EM; seeded at kickoff with initial steps up to PM→EM handoff; after handoff, EM adds arch steps (if needed), HLD, and then the detailed implementation plan (full phase-by-phase breakdown with numbered steps, responsible agents, artifacts, loop exit conditions, and human checkpoints); always add a 👤 human gate after the implementation plan before execution begins; the orchestrator works through it top-to-bottom and stops when it reaches the end, waiting for EM to add the next batch
- Kickoff Plan (`workflow/kickoff-plan.md`) -- orchestrator is author
- Eng Plans (HLD) (`generated-docs/architecture/hld.md`) -- EM is gatekeeper
